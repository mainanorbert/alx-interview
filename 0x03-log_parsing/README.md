# Log Parsing
`Parsing` in Python refers to the process of analyzing a string or text input to extract meaningful information. This is commonly done when working with data formats like JSON, XML, or even simple text files. Parsing involves breaking down the input into its components (tokens) and then interpreting the structure to understand its meaning.
# Parsing Libraries
Python provides several libraries for parsing different types of data formats, such as json for JSON, xml.etree.ElementTree for XML, and csv for CSV files. Additionally, libraries like BeautifulSoup and lxml are commonly used for parsing HTML and XML data from web pages.
