# Star Wars API
The Star Wars API, or SWAPI, is an open API that provides access to a vast amount of Star Wars-related data, including information about films, characters, starships, vehicles, species, and planets from the Star Wars universe. SWAPI is a RESTful API, which means it uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to retrieve and manipulate data.
